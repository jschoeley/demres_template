# Figures and Tables

Variably referred to as de Finetti-, simplex-, or triangle plot, the ternary diagram is based upon a coordinate system that maps each point within an equilateral triangle to a unique three-part composition and as such has found use wherever the problem domain spans three parts of a whole. The diagram emerged during the 18th century as a means of illustrating relative mixtures of primary colors [@Howarth1996]. It was subsequently adopted as the standard method to depict phase transitions in three-component alloys [@Bancroft1897], the genotype composition of a population [@DeFinetti1926], soil composition [@Davis1927], or the potential for flammability given different mixtures of three gases [@Zabetakis1965]. In the social sciences, ternary diagrams depict population compositions along demographic characteristics, with an early example appearing in the USSR's first census report showing the distribution of workers across labor market segments in various regions [@Kvitkin1932].^[A footnote [@Ware2013].]

# Equations

Given the observed death counts $D_{jk}$ in age group $j$ and stratum $k$ and associated person-days of exposure to risk $O_{jk}$ I fit the model

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    D_{jk} &\sim \text{Pois}\left(\lambda_{jk}O_{jk}\right) \\
    \lambda_{jk} &= e^{\beta_{0k} +
    \beta_{1k}\log(x_{jk}+1) +
    \beta_{2k}\log^2(x_{jk}+1)},
  \end{aligned}
(\#eq:themodel)
\end{equation}

where $\lambda_{jk}$ are mortality rates by age group and stratum. For each stratum, a smooth hazard is recovered by evaluating $\lambda_{jk}$ over a continuous range of ages $x$.

The stratum specific coefficients $\beta_{0k}$, $\beta_{1k}$, $\beta_{2k}$ are sums of baseline coefficients $\beta$, prematurity effects $\beta^\text{Pm}$, prematurity-birth weight interactions $\beta^{\text{Pm}\times\text{Bw}}$, and prematurity-birth weight-Apgar interactions $\beta^{\text{Pm}\times\text{Bw}\times\text{Ap}}$ resulting in the multilevel structure

$$
\left(\begin{aligned}
\beta_{0k} \\
\beta_{1k} \\
\beta_{2k}
\end{aligned}\right) =
\underbrace{\left(\begin{aligned}
\beta_0 \\
\beta_1 \\
\beta_2
\end{aligned}\right)}_{\substack{\text{lvl 0} \\ \text{ baseline coef.}}} +
\underbrace{\left(\begin{aligned}
\beta_{0,p[k]}^\text{Pm} \\
\beta_{1,p[k]}^\text{Pm} \\
\beta_{2,p[k]}^\text{Pm}
\end{aligned}\right)}_{\substack{\text{lvl 1} \\ \text{ deviations by} \\ \text{prematurity}}} +
\underbrace{\left(\begin{aligned}
\beta_{0,p[k],b[k]}^{\text{Pm}\times\text{Bw}} \\
\beta_{1,p[k],b[k]}^{\text{Pm}\times\text{Bw}} \\
\beta_{2,p[k],b[k]}^{\text{Pm}\times\text{Bw}}
\end{aligned}\right)}_{\substack{\text{lvl 2} \\ \text{ deviations by} \\ \text{birth weight given} \\ \text{prematurity}}} +
\underbrace{\left(\begin{aligned}
\beta_{0,p[k],b[k],a[k]}^{\text{Pm}\times\text{Bw}\times\text{Ap}} \\
\beta_{1,p[k],b[k],a[k]}^{\text{Pm}\times\text{Bw}\times\text{Ap}} \\
\beta_{2,p[k],b[k],a[k]}^{\text{Pm}\times\text{Bw}\times\text{Ap}}
\end{aligned}\right)}_{\substack{\text{lvl 3} \\ \text{ deviations by} \\ \text{Apgar given} \\ \text{prematurity and} \\ \text{birth weight}}},
$$

where $p[k], b[k]$ and $a[k]$ denote the prematurity, birth weight and Apgar level associated with stratum $k$. Except for the baseline $\beta$'s each set of coefficients is assumed to be drawn from a multivariate-Normal distribution with zero mean and covariance matrix

$$
\Sigma = \begin{pmatrix}
    \sigma^2_{\beta_0} & \sigma_{\beta_0\beta_1} & \sigma_{\beta_0\beta_2} \\
    \sigma_{\beta_0\beta_1} & \sigma^2_{\beta_1} & \sigma_{\beta_1\beta_2} \\
    \sigma_{\beta_0\beta_2} & \sigma_{\beta_1\beta_2} & \sigma^2_{\beta_2}
    \end{pmatrix},
$$

with separate estimates for levels one to three.
