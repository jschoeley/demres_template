A color scheme typology is presented here that matches a comprehensive listing of the ways in which data are organized to corresponding organizations of hue and lightness, with secondary attention to saturation. Appropriate use of color for data display allows interrelationships and patterns within data to be easily visualized. The careless use of color will obscure these patterns. Careful use of color on maps is particularly important in interactive and animated map contexts, where the map reader must attend to changing patterns on the maps and has little time to look back and forth to a map legend, if one is offered at all. A spontaneously under- stood color scheme is a great asset in these contexts.},

Its present utility, however, is limited to the domain of one-dimensional magnitudes such as rates and counts. Visualizing proportions among three or more groups on a period-age grid is an unsolved problem. OBJECTIVE We seek to extend the Lexis surface plot to the domain of compositional data. METHODS We propose four techniques for visualizing group compositions on a period-age grid. To demonstrate the techniques we use data on age-specific cause-of-death compositions in France from 1925 to 1999. We compare the visualizations for compliance with multiple desired criteria. RESULTS Compositional data can effectively be visualized on the Lexis surface. A key feature of the classical Lexis surface plot -- to show age, period, and cohort patterns -- is retained in the domain of compositions. The optimal choice among the four proposed techniques depends primarily on the number of groups making up the composition and whether or not the plot should be readable by people with impaired colour vision. CONTRIBUTION We introduce techniques for visualizing compositional data on a period-age grid to the field of demography and demonstrate the usefulness of the techniques by performing an exploratory analysis of age-specific French cause-of-death patterns across the 20\textsuperscript{th} century. We identify strengths and weaknesses of the four proposed techniques. We contribute a technique to construct the ternary-balance colour scheme from within a per- ceptually uniform colour space.},

However, the male: female prevalence ratio is markedly different in Europeans and Asians. Recent surveys suggest that the prevalence is rising in men of African ethnicity and in geographic areas that have been settled by incoming migrants.

  year      = {2003},
  pages     = {2341--2353},
  abstract  = {Soil has four basic components: organic and inorganic matter, water and air. Soil texture is an expression of the composition of the inorganic matter in a soil and it affects soil behaviour (e.g. infiltration, fertility, susceptibility to erosion, soil structure). The knowledge of soil texture is fundamental to the interpretation of soils capabilities. Moreover, most soil taxonomic classification systems (USDA, FAO, South Africa, Australian, etc.) specify with more or less detail the dominant soil texture (e.g. the percentage of sand, silt and clay particles). There is a lack of standards for cartographic presentation of soil maps, unlike in geology where the adoption of colours for different geologic units is standardised, selection of colours for representing different soil types is often arbitrary. Accordingly, this paper proposes a new method for cartographic representation of soil maps based on spectral encoding of soil texture using a trivariate colour scheme. The visualization method involves extending the U.S.D.A. soil textural triangle by assigning one substrative primary colour (e.g. yellow, magenta and cyan) to each axis of the triangle. In this way a unique colour hue is generated for each possible textural class used in soil classification. The trivariate spectral encoding can be applied in either a continuos or discrete manner. For each soil unit, its color can be selected from the exact textural composition (e.g. laboratory determinations of clay, silt and sand percentages), creating a continous spectral encoding. Conversely, spectral encoding can also be applied in a discrete manner by assigning the colour representative of the textural family (e.g. loamy, silty, sandy loam textures). Such colour is defined by the middle point of the polygon representing that particular textural class. Because of this, the trivariate spectral encoding can be applied to the different taxonomic systems used by soil survey organisation worldwide, making it an adaptable and robust scheme.},

A variety of independence hypotheses are introduced and interrelated, and new classes of transformed-normal distributions in the simplex are provided as models within which the independence hypotheses can be tested through standard theory of parametric hypothesis testing. The new concepts and statistical methodology are illustrated by a number of applications.},

To help overcome difficulties in comprehending modeling results that are expressed as probability distributions, to capture uncertainties, we introduce methods to spatially display and compare the output from Bayesian network models and to use these methods to compare model predictions for three management scenarios. Model predictions suggest that management intervention has made a substantial improvement to the condition of management outcome measures and that further improvements are possible. The results highlight that the management impacts are spatially variable, which demonstrates that farm modeling can provide valuable evidence in substantiating the impact of catchment management intervention.},

In order to produce ggtern, it was necessary to overcome a number of design issues, such as finding a means to modify existing geometries designed for a 2D Cartesian coordinate system and permitting them to function in an environment that requires an additional spatial aesthetic mapping. In the present paper, we provide examples of this package in its most basic form followed by a demonstration of its ease of use, particularly if one is familiar with, and has a predilection towards using ggplot2 on a regular basis.},

Objective: Using data on young adult mortality in the 32 Mexican states from 1990 to 2015, we demonstrate how aligning small multiples for territorial units, often regions, according to their approximate geographical location -- geofaceting -- can be used to depict complex multi-dimensional phenomena.

Methods: The idea is to align small-multiples for territorial units, often regions, according to approximate geographical location. We illustrate the technique using data on young adult mortality in the 32 Mexican states from 1990 to 2015.

Results: Geofaceting reveals the macro-level spatial pattern while preserving the flexibility of choosing any visualization techniques for the small multiples. Creating geofaceted visualizations gives all the advantages of standard plots in which one can adequately display multiple dimensions of a dataset.

Contribution: Compared to other ways of small-multiples' arrangement, geofaceting improves the speed of regions' identification and exposes the broad spatial pattern.},
